<h3><em>Ford Vs Ferrari</em></h3>
<p>
  American car designer Carroll Shelby and driver Ken Miles battle corporate
  interference and the laws of physics to build a revolutionary race car for
  Ford in order to defeat Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
  In the mid-1960s, Enzo Ferrari's fast Rosso-Corsa racing cars were dominating
  the motorsport world. Meanwhile, Carroll Shelby, an American car designer, had
  retired after winning the demanding 1959 '24 Hours of Le Mans' endurance race.
  However, an unexpected proposition from Lee Iacocca, the Vice President of
  Henry Ford II's motor company, presented an opportunity to beat the Italians
  at their own game. Under these pressing circumstances, Ken Miles, a British
  sports car driver and racing engineer, reluctantly agreed to help improve the
  Americans' image. But Ford's race team had less than ninety days to rewrite
  history. As a result, the non-conformist duo came up with the Ford GT40 Mk I,
  a powerful, high-performance racing car. Nevertheless, the question remained.

  American automotive designer Carroll Shelby and British race car driver Ken
  Miles compete in a fierce corporate battle as well as nature itself, to build
  a vehicle for the Ford automobiles. Together, they plan to compete against the
  race cars of Enzo Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in France in 1966.

  Ford Company has a big problem in selling its cars in the 1960s. They decide
  to take part in 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance race to show and advertise their
  cars. Ferrari's fast racing cars dominate the mid-60s racing world. Ford's
  advertisement team request Carrol Shelby to build fast cars for the race.
  Shelby asks British driver and racing engineer, Ken Miles to be the main
  driver for Ford's company in the race.

<p>
  Dramatizes a specific item from automotive history. It's the early 1960s, and
  the iconic American company, Ford Motors, is facing some difficult times. Vice
  president Lee Iacocca believes they have to make the company sexier to the
  American consumer by setting up a race car division, akin to Ferrari, which
  has reigned supreme at the ultimate automobile race, the twenty-hour hour race
  at Le Mans. President Henry Ford II makes an offer to buy for sale Ferrari,
  the offer which Enzo Ferrari only uses to make a more lucrative deal with
  Fiat, in the process Ferrari also denigrating what he considers overbloated
  Ford. As such, Ford spares no expense for his own race car division, he hiring
  Le Mans winner turned sports car designer and manufacturer Carroll Shelby as
  the engineering head of that race car division. Ford's ultimate goal is to
  beat Ferrari at Le Mans. Shelby knows that money alone cannot produce success,
  and that equally as important is racing inherent in the company's culture. As
  such, he hires as part of his design team Ken Miles, whose life is racing
  which he has built into his supportive family of wife Mollie and their
  adolescent son Peter. Shelby finds that his ultimate opponent is not Ferrari
  but rather the corporate mentality at Ford, especially of Ford himself and who
  Ford appoints as head of the race car division, Leo Beebe, who in particular
  doesn't see bohemian Miles as "Ford material". Making the situation more
  difficult is that Shelby believes, in he knowing the machine, that Miles is
  the best person as driver. —Huggo

<h2>SYNOPSIS</h2>
<p>
  Synopsis In 1963, Ford is losing market share to Chrysler, and this makes
  Henry Ford II mad. He is looking for a new idea that can propel sales for his
  cars. Ford Motor Company Vice President Lee Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) proposes to
  Henry Ford II to purchase the cash-strapped Ferrari as a means to boost their
  car sales by participating in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Iacocca argues that the
  baby boomers have cash in their pockets, but want sex appeal and beauty in
  their cars, and they want them fast. None of this is what Ford gives. Owner
  Enzo Ferrari (Remo Girone) uses Ford's offer to secure a deal with Fiat (who
  agree to pay $18 million for Ferrari) that allows him to retain ownership of
  the firm's racing team, Scuderia Ferrari. Ford's deal would given 90% control
  of car production to Ford, and Ferrari would own 90% of the car racing
  division.
</p>
<p>
  In rejecting the proposed deal with Ford, Ferrari insults the company and its
  CEO. He says that Ford is only good for making small and ugly cars and that
  Henry is not a real Ford. A furious Henry II (Tracy Letts) orders his racing
  division to build a car to defeat Ferrari at Le Mans. For this task, Iacocca
  hires Shelby American owner Carroll Shelby (Matt Damon), a racing driver who
  won Le Mans in 1959 (The only American to do so at that time, and Shelby was
  driving the Aston Martin when he won the race) but was forced to retire due to
  his heart condition (a bad valve that will kill him the minute his heart rate
  touches 130).
</p>
<p>
  In turn, Shelby enlists the help of Ken Miles (Christian Bale), a hot-tempered
  British racer and struggling mechanic. Miles is a big believer that a car has
  to be driven like it has been designed. Miles is married to Mollie (Caitríona
  Balfe) and has a son. Miles designs his own race cars, which are often
  disqualified for not meeting regulations on minor points such as luggage space
  and doors not locking properly. Shelby worked together with Miles on several
  races and knew that PR was not Miles' strong suit, but he builds and drives
  fast cars capable of winning endurance races. To win at Le Mans, they need a
  car that can do 200 MPH on a straight and maintain that for 3000 miles. Le
  Mans is not a track, it is a country road. A million things can go wrong, and
  with every mistake, Ferrari wins again as they have always done. Shelby and
  Miles have 90 days to deliver.
</p>
<p>
  Shelby and Miles test the Ford GT40 Mk I prototype at Los Angeles
  International Airport, working out all of its design flaws until it is race
  ready. At the launch of the new Ford Mustang, Miles gives a witheringly rude
  appraisal of it to Ford Senior Vice President Leo Beebe (Josh Lucas). Beebe
  campaigns against sending Miles to the upcoming race at Le Mans as a public
  relations liability. Shelby reluctantly excludes Miles and sends Phil Hill and
  Bruce McLaren (Benjamin Rigby) to 1964 Le Mans.
</p>
<p>
  As predicted by Miles, none of the Fords finish the race. While Henry II sees
  this as a humiliating defeat, Shelby explains to him that the GT40 instilled
  fear in Enzo Ferrari, as it reached 218 mph on the Mulsanne Straight before it
  broke down. He says a race car cannot be designed by committee. Ford tells him
  to continue the project and report directly to him.
</p>
<p>
  Shelby and Miles continue development on the GT40 Mk II, but Miles is nearly
  killed when the car's brakes fail during testing. The team realizes the rules
  permit replacing the whole brake assembly during the race. In 1966, Ford
  Senior Vice President Leo Beebe takes over the racing division, with the
  intent to continue the program without Miles. When he and Ford arrive to
  inspect the program, Shelby locks Beebe in his office and gives Ford a ride in
  the GT40. Shelby wagers his own company on the line to convince him that if
  Miles wins the 24 Hours of Daytona, he will be allowed to race at Le Mans. If
  not, Ford will take full ownership of Shelby American.
</p>
<p>
  Shelby American enters Daytona, but Beebe has a second Ford entered with
  NASCAR team Holman-Moody supporting it. While the Holman-Moody team has
  quicker pit stops, Shelby has Miles push his car's limit to 7,000 RPM,
  resulting in him winning the race.
</p>
<p>
  At the 1966 Le Mans, Miles struggles with a faulty door during the first lap,
  but after team engineer Phil Remington (Ray McKinnon) fixes the door with a
  mallet, Miles begins to set lap records while catching up with the Ferraris.
  While racing with Ferrari driver Lorenzo Bandini (Francesco Bauco) - piloting
  Ferrari's new prototype 330 P3 - Miles experiences brake failure and has his
  brake system replaced during his pit stop. Enzo Ferrari protests the move, but
  Shelby convinces the race officials that the brake change is legal.
</p>
<p>
  Miles and Bandini once again duel on the Mulsanne Straight until Bandini blows
  his engine, completely eliminating Ferrari in the race. With three Ford teams
  in the top-three positions, Beebe orders Shelby to have Miles slow down for
  the other two Fords to catch up with him and provide the press with a
  three-car photo finish. Miles is initially against this decision, continuing
  to set new lap records near the end of the race, but decides to let Ford have
  their way on the final lap. Ultimately, McLaren is declared the winner on a
  technicality. Having started behind Miles, his car traveled further overall.
  Miles is placed second. Shelby accuses Beebe of deliberately costing Miles the
  win. Miles is grateful to Shelby for giving him the opportunity to race at Le
  Mans. From his vantage point, Enzo Ferrari tips his hat to Miles on the track.
  As they walk off together, Shelby tells Miles they will win Le Mans next time.
</p>
<p>
  Two months after Le Mans, while testing the J-car at Riverside International
  Raceway, Miles once again experiences brake failure and is killed in the
  resulting crash. Six months later, Shelby pays Miles' widow Mollie (Caitriona
  Balfe) and son Peter (Noah Jupe) a visit and gives Peter a wrench that Miles
  threw at him before winning an SCCA race at Willow Springs in 1963. Ford would
  continue its winning streak at Le Mans in 1967 (using the GT40 Mk IV,
  developed from the J-car), 1968, and 1969, becoming the only American
  manufacturer to win the prestigious race. Miles would be posthumously inducted
  into the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 2001

<h3><em>Gran Turisimo</em></h3>
<h4>SYNOPSIS</h4>
<p>
  Kazunori Yamauchi (Takehiro Hira), is the creator of Gran Turismo, the most
  accurate racing simulator of all time. Kanzunori wanted to make racing
  accessible to all.
</p>
<p>
  Following a pitch by marketing executive Danny Moore (Orlando Bloom), Nismo,
  the motor-sport division of Nissan establishes the GT Academy to recruit
  skilled players of the racing simulator Gran Turismo and turn them into real
  racing drivers. Danny believes that 80 million youth play the Gran Tourismo.
  If he can convert one of them into a racing champion, that would open up a
  whole new category for their physical cars.
</p>
<p>
  Danny recruits former driver-turned-mechanic Jack Salter (David Harbour) to
  train the players. Jack is initially hesitant but accepts after tiring of the
  arrogance of his team's driver, Nicholas Capa (Josha Stradowski). Jack
  believes that putting a kid from behind his console into a 200 mile an hour
  rocket is dangerous, but Danny is convinced that the kids have more track time
  than any of the professional racers. Meanwhile, Jann Mardenborough (Archie
  Madekwe), a teenage clothing store employee and gamer from Cardiff, Wales, is
  an avid player of the simulator and wants to become a racing driver, despite
  the disapproval of his former footballer father Steve Mardenborough (Djimon
  Hounsou). Jann argues that racing cars is what he is good at, it's what he
  loves.
</p>
<p>
  One day, Jann learns he is eligible for a qualification race to join the GT
  Academy after setting a time record for a particular track. The night before
  his race, Jann is invited by his brother Coby to a party, and the brothers
  take their father's car. Jann flirts with a young woman named Audrey (Maeve
  Courtier-Lilley) whom he develops a crush on. The gathering is disbanded after
  police arrive, and Jann initiates a pursuit after driving away when their
  friends are pulled over. The brothers escape but are caught returning by their
  father. Coby (Daniel Puig) starts to worry, but Jann offers to take the blame
  for him if he admits that he is the better driver. Jann is taken to his
  father's place of employment the next morning in an attempt to be taught a
  life lesson (Steve says that either Jann gets an education, or he joins Steve
  at the rail-yard since he has no other plans. Steve says that there is no
  future in racing), but leaves early to partake in the qualifying race, which
  he wins, earning a place in GT Academy.
</p>
<p>
  At the academy camp in Silverstone UK, Jack puts the competitors (Including
  Jann, Matty, Antonio, Frederick, Leah Vega (Emelia Hartford), Joo-Hwan Lee
  (Sang Heon Lee), Klaus Hoffman (Max Mundt), Henry Evas (Mariano González), Avi
  Bhatt (Harki Bhambra), Chloe McCormick (Lindsay Pattison), Marcel Durand (Théo
  Christine))through their paces in various tests, through which ten competitors
  are narrowed down to five. During one of which, Jann crashes with Jack in the
  car and claims the brakes were glazed, later proven correct by analysts, to
  Jack's surprise. The remaining five compete in a final race to determine who
  will represent Nissan. Jann narrowly wins the race against American competitor
  Matty Davis (Darren Barnet), but Danny insists Matty should be chosen as the
  representative due to his better commercial viability and due to Jann not
  being press ready and awkward in front of the camera. However, Jann is chosen
  at Jack's insistence.
</p>
<p>
  Jann is told that if he finishes at least fourth in any one of a series of
  qualifying races, he will earn a professional license and contract with
  Nissan. He finishes last in his first professional race in Austria after
  Nicholas taps him into a spin, and despite gradually improving over the next
  few races, he does not finish the penultimate race in Spain. He travels to
  Dubai for his last qualifying race, during which Nicholas takes a corner too
  fast and crashes. Despite the debris from this crash cracking his windshield,
  Jann achieves a fourth-place finish and earns his license. He then travels to
  Tokyo with Danny and Jack to sign his contract and uses his signing bonus to
  fly Audrey to Tokyo. During this time, they initiate a relationship.
</p>
<p>
  Jann's first race after signing is at the Nürburgring Nordschleife. He starts
  the race well and maintains a high position until the front of his car lifts
  into the air at the Flugplatz corner, hitting a barrier and launching into a
  crowded spectator area. Jann is airlifted to the Nürburgring Medical Center
  and is informed while in hospital that a spectator was killed in the crash,
  much to his horror. Reluctant to return to racing and blaming himself for the
  spectator's death, Jack takes him back to the Nürburgring, during which he
  reveals he was involved in a fatal accident at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, which
  led to a fellow driver dying and his retirement from driving. An inquiry
  clears Jann of any wrongdoing, but professional sentiment begins to turn
  against sim drivers. In response, Danny decidea sim driver team should compete
  at Le Mans and finish on the podium to prove their viability.
</p>
<p>
  Danny enlists Matty and fellow GT Academy participant Antonio Cruz (Pepe
  Barroso) to make up the three-driver team alongside Jann. On race day, Jann's
  father apologizes for not initially being supportive of his passions. Early in
  the race, Jann is left shaken after Frederik Schulin's (Niall McShea) car
  crashes and catches fire, but is encouraged through his first shift by Jack
  playing "Songbird" and "Orinoco Flow" through the car's communication system,
  which Jann had previously used as motivational music during training. Matty
  and Antonio complete their first shifts without issue, but the latter is
  brought in from his last session early due to experiencing cramps. A wheel nut
  is dropped by mechanic Felix (Richard Cambridge) during the pit stop, causing
  Jann to lose several positions. He deviates from advised racing lines he
  learned from playing Gran Turismo to regain his positions, breaking the
  competition lap record in the process. The final lap sees Jann pitted against
  Nicholas, with Jann once again narrowly in front on the final straight to earn
  third place and a podium finish for Nissan.
</p>
<p>
  In the epilogue, the real Jann Mardenborough is shown having competed in over
  200 races and served as his own stunt double in the film
